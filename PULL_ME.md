## Round 1 — Real pipeline timings (Option B)

Commit: _see `git log` on branch `kronos`_

Server now measures each pipeline stage with `time.perf_counter()` and
returns a `timings_ms` object on the /upload response. The frontend uses
those values to overwrite the wall-clock step time labels with honest
per-stage durations after the API resolves. The fake step delays are
reduced to short visual placeholders so we don't block on theater.

- [ ] `server.py` — added `import time`, wrapped `analyze()`, `ask_agent()`, `cross_check_numbers()` with `perf_counter()`, added `timings_ms: { analyze, llm, verify }` to the JSON response. Also logs the same stage durations to MLflow (`analyze_ms`, `llm_ms`, `verify_ms`) when tracking is enabled.
- [ ] `static/main.js` — shrank `STEP_DELAYS` from `[800, 1400, 600, 0, 500]` to `[150, 250, 100, 0, 150]`; after `apiResult` resolves, overwrites `time-0`…`time-4` labels using `apiResult.timings_ms` (split `analyze` across steps 0+1, map `llm` to step 3, `verify` to step 4).

**Behavior change:** the step animation runs faster during the wait, and the final displayed times reflect real server work. The LLM step will visibly be the longest — which is the truth.

**Compatibility:** if a response doesn't include `timings_ms` (old server, mock fallback), the wall-clock times are used — nothing breaks.
